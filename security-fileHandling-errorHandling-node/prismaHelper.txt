npm i -D prisma

npm i @prisma/client

npx prisma init (This creates:
1. prisma/schema.prisma: The schema file where you'll define your data models.
2. .env: Environment file to store your connection string and other configuration variables.)

configure env (for mongodb make sure to add the DB_NAME else error 8000 will be thrown)

npx prisma generate (This command generates the Prisma Client based on your schema and makes it available for use in your project.)

npx prisma db push (This command will sync the database schema with your MongoDB database, applying the changes you made in the schema.prisma file.)
